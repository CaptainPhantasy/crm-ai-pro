# GLOBAL RULES - MUST FOLLOW

## NO WEBPACK - EVER
- **NEVER** add webpack configuration to next.config.mjs
- **NEVER** install webpack, css-loader, style-loader, or any webpack-related packages
- **NEVER** use webpack.config.js files
- Next.js handles bundling internally - DO NOT TOUCH IT
- If you see webpack errors, fix the actual problem, don't add webpack config

## Why?
- Webpack is unstable and causes constant issues
- Next.js has its own bundler - don't interfere
- Adding webpack config always causes problems and requires downgrades
