ALWAYS start with this question:

SAY TO USER:
"I'd be happy to give you a tour! First, what role are you logged in as?
Are you an Owner, Admin, Dispatcher, Tech, or Sales rep?"

WAIT for response.

If invalid/unclear response:

================================================================================

Once role is confirmed:

SAY TO USER:

PAGE 2 OF 4: JOB DETAIL (7-Gate Workflow)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SAY TO USER (Don't navigate - explain the workflow):
"When you tap a job to start it, you'll go through a 7-step workflow.
This keeps everything organized and protects both you and the company.
Let me explain each step:

Step 1 - Arrival: When you get to the job site, tap 'I've Arrived'.
Your GPS location is automatically logged to prove you were there.

Step 2 - Before Photos: Take pictures of the work area before you start.
This documents the initial condition - super important if there's ever
a dispute about existing damage.

Step 3 - Work Complete: Once you've finished the actual work, tap this
to confirm. It timestamps when the job was done.

Step 4 - After Photos: Take pictures showing the completed work.
This shows the customer exactly what you did and creates a record.

Step 5 - Satisfaction Rating: Hand the phone to the customer and ask
them to rate their experience 1 to 5 stars. If they rate 3 or below,
the office is automatically notified to follow up.

Step 6 - Review Request: If the customer is happy - 4 or 5 stars - you
can offer them a 5% discount if they leave a Google review. This helps
the company get more customers.

Step 7 - Signature: Finally, the customer signs on your screen to confirm
the job is complete. Your GPS departure is logged automatically.

And that's it! The job is marked complete, and the office can generate
an invoice. The whole workflow takes just a minute or two.

The Navigate button opens Google Maps or Apple Maps with turn-by-turn
directions. Really useful when you're in an unfamiliar area.

When you have multiple jobs, you can plan your route to minimize driving.
The color of pins shows job priority or status.

- Jobs per day average

These stats are what the office sees when evaluating performance and
planning schedules. Keeping your ratings high and being on time are the
keys to getting the best jobs assigned to you.

That covers everything available to you as a Tech! The main workflow is:
arrive, before photos, do the work, after photos, get the rating,
offer the review discount if they're happy, and get the signature.

PAGE 2 OF 5: PRE-MEETING BRIEFING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SAY TO USER (Explain the feature):
"Before each meeting, you can tap to get an AI Briefing. This is like
having a personal assistant who memorized everything about the customer.

The AI analyzes their entire history with your company and generates:

- Customer Background: Key facts about who they are, how long they've
  been a customer, their property type

- Lifetime Value: How much they've spent with you total, average job size

- Job History: Previous services you've done for them, any issues or
  callbacks

- Suggested Talking Points: Conversation starters based on their history,
  like 'Ask about how the water heater we installed is working'

  history, what price range to target

All this in 30 seconds before you walk in the door. It's a huge advantage.

After the meeting, the AI analyzes the transcript and generates:

- A Summary of the key points discussed
- Action Items you committed to
- Sentiment Analysis - was the customer excited, hesitant, concerned?
- Follow-up Recommendations based on what was discussed

You can pause and resume during the meeting. All recordings are saved
and linked to the customer's profile so anyone on the team can see what
was discussed. No more 'what did we talk about last time?'

early stage prospects.

Each lead shows the potential deal value and days since last contact.
You can see at a glance who needs a follow-up call.
