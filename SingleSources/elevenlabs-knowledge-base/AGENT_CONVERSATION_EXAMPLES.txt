AGENT: "Perfect. When would be a good time for a technician to come out?"

        between 9 and 11 AM. Does that work for you?"

                   EXAMPLE 3: RETURNING CALLER
================================================================================

--- Call Start ---

[System provides caller phone: 555-123-4567]

AGENT (internal): Execute read_agent_memory("555-123-4567")
RESULT: {
  found: true,
  summary: "John Smith at 123 Main St needs water heater repair",
  intent: "in_progress",
  stagingData: '{"contactId": "uuid-123", "issue": "water heater"}'
}

AGENT: "Welcome back, John! I see we were setting up a job for your water
        heater. Would you like to continue from where we left off?"

USER: "Yes please, we got disconnected"

AGENT: "No problem! I have your address at 123 Main Street and the issue
        is that your water heater isn't heating. We just need to schedule
        a time. When works for you?"

USER: "Can someone come today?"

AGENT (internal): Check availability

AGENT: "Let me check... I have an opening this afternoon between 2 and 4 PM.
        Would that work?"

USER: "Perfect"

AGENT (internal): Execute create_job(...with today's date...)

AGENT: "Great! You're all set for today between 2 and 4 PM. A technician

================================================================================
                   EXAMPLE 4: ONBOARDING TOUR
================================================================================

USER: "I'm new here, can you show me around?"

AGENT: "I'd be happy to give you a tour! First, what role are you logged in as?
        Are you an Owner, Admin, Dispatcher, Tech, or Sales rep?"

USER: "I'm a dispatcher"

AGENT: "Great, you're logged in as a Dispatcher. Let me take you through the
        pages available to you. I'll navigate to each section, explain what
        it does, and wait for you to tell me when you're ready for the next
        one. Let's begin!"

AGENT (internal): Execute navigate(page: "dispatch")

[Wait 2 seconds]

AGENT: "This is the Dispatch Map - your command center. You can see all
        technicians in real-time with GPS tracking. Jobs appear as pins
        on the map. The left sidebar shows each tech with their status,
        current job, and performance rating. You can drag jobs to assign
        them, or use auto-assign to let the system pick the best tech
        based on location and workload. This is where you'll spend most
        of your time! Ready for the next section?"

USER: "Yes"

AGENT (internal): Execute navigate(page: "jobs")

[Wait 2 seconds]

AGENT: "The Jobs page shows all work orders in a list view. You can filter
        by status, date, or technician. From here you create new jobs when
        customers call in, assign them to techs, and track progress.
        Ready to continue?"

USER: "Actually, go back to the map"

AGENT (internal): Execute navigate(page: "dispatch")

AGENT: "No problem, we're back on the Dispatch Map. Was there something
        specific you wanted to know about it, or should I explain more
        about the features?"

USER: "How do I assign a job to a tech?"

AGENT: "Good question! There are two ways. First, you can drag a job pin
        from the map directly onto a technician in the sidebar. Second,
        you can click on a job, then click 'Assign' and pick a tech from
        the list. There's also an 'Auto-Assign' button that uses AI to
        pick the best available tech based on their location, workload,
        and skills. Want me to show you the Jobs page next, or do you have
        more questions about the map?"

================================================================================
                   EXAMPLE 5: HANDLING ERRORS
================================================================================

USER: "Create a job for Tom Wilson"

AGENT (internal): Execute search_contacts("Tom Wilson")
RESULT: [] (empty)

USER: "Oh wait, I think his name is Tom Williams"

AGENT (internal): Execute search_contacts("Tom Williams")
RESULT: [{ id: "uuid-tom", first_name: "Tom", last_name: "Williams" }]

USER: "Drain cleaning"

AGENT (internal): Execute create_job(contactId: "uuid-tom",
                  description: "Drain cleaning")

AGENT: "Done! I've created a drain cleaning job for Tom Williams.
        When should it be scheduled?"

        2. Bob Johnson on Oak Ave - has a lead from last week"

USER: "Mary Johnson"

RESULT: job-mary-123

AGENT: "Got it, Mary Johnson's job tomorrow. Which technician should I assign?"

USER: "Who's available?"

AGENT: "Your available technicians are Mike, Sarah, and Dave. Mike is
        closest to that area and has a 4.9 rating. Sarah specializes in
        the type of work needed. Dave has a lighter schedule tomorrow.
        Who would you like?"

USER: "Assign Mike"

AGENT (internal): Execute assign_tech(jobId: "job-mary-123", techId: "mike-uuid")

AGENT: "Done! Mike is now assigned to Mary Johnson's job for tomorrow.

AGENT (internal): Execute update_job_status(jobId: job1, status: "completed")

AGENT: "Done! John Smith's leak repair is now marked as complete.
        Would you like me to generate the invoice?"

USER: "Yes"

AGENT (internal): Execute invoice generation

AGENT: "Invoice generated and ready to send. The total is $175. Should I
        send it to John Smith now?"

USER: "Send it"

AGENT (internal): Execute send invoice

AGENT: "Sent! John Smith will receive the invoice by email. Anything else?"

================================================================================
                   EXAMPLE 8: QUESTION DURING WORKFLOW
================================================================================

[In the middle of creating a job]

AGENT: "What work does the customer need done?"

USER: "Oh wait - do I have anything scheduled for this afternoon?"

AGENT (internal): Quick context switch - user has a question

AGENT (internal): Execute check today's schedule

AGENT: "Yes, you have 2 jobs this afternoon - one at 2 PM and one at 4 PM.
        Both have technicians assigned. Now, back to the new job - what
        work does the customer need?"

USER: "A leak repair"

AGENT: "Got it, leak repair. When should we schedule this?"

================================================================================
                   EXAMPLE 9: MOBILE TECH HELP
================================================================================

USER: "How do I complete a job?"

AGENT: "On your mobile app, when you're at a job, you'll go through 7 steps.
        First, tap 'I've Arrived' when you get there - that logs your GPS.
        Then take before photos. After you do the work, tap 'Work Complete'
        and take after photos. Ask the customer to rate 1 to 5 stars. If
        they're happy, offer the review discount. Finally, get their
        signature. Once signed, the job is done and the office can invoice.
        Is there a specific step you need help with?"

USER: "The photo part isn't working"

AGENT: "That can happen if camera permissions aren't enabled. Go to your
        phone's settings, find the CRM AI Pro app, and make sure Camera
        is turned on. If it's already on, try closing and reopening the
        app. Still having trouble after that?"

================================================================================
                   EXAMPLE 10: SALES BRIEFING
================================================================================

USER: "I have a meeting with the Hendersons in 20 minutes. What do I need
       to know?"

AGENT (internal): Execute search for Henderson contact
AGENT (internal): Execute get briefing/history

AGENT: "Here's your briefing for the Henderson meeting:

        The Hendersons have been customers since 2022. They're at the large
        property on Maple Drive - about 3,500 square feet. Their lifetime
        spend is $4,200 across 6 jobs.

        Last service was a water heater replacement 8 months ago. They paid
        promptly and gave a 5-star rating.

        Suggested talking points:
        - Check if the water heater is still working well
        - Their HVAC system is 12 years old - might be worth mentioning
          maintenance plans
        - They've referred two neighbors to you before

        Based on their history, they're comfortable with premium pricing.
        Good luck with the meeting! Want me to set a reminder to follow up?"

================================================================================
