================================================================================

Version: 1.0
Last Updated: November 28, 2025

Technicians complete jobs using a 7-step workflow on their mobile app.
Understanding this helps you explain the process and troubleshoot issues.

================================================================================
                         OVERVIEW
================================================================================

The 7-Gate system ensures:
  - Proper documentation (before/after photos)
  - GPS verification (arrival/departure proof)
  - Customer satisfaction tracking
  - Review generation for marketing
  - Legal protection (signed authorization)

Each gate must be completed in order. Techs cannot skip gates.

                  EXPLAINING TO USERS
================================================================================

If a Tech asks about the workflow:

"The 7-gate system walks you through completing each job properly.
First you mark your arrival, which logs your GPS. Then you take before
photos to document the starting condition. After doing the work, you
tap 'work complete' and take after photos. Then the customer rates their
experience 1 to 5 stars. If they're happy - 4 or 5 stars - you can offer
them a small discount for leaving a Google review. Finally, they sign
on your screen and you're done. The whole documentation takes just a
couple minutes and protects everyone."

If someone asks why photos are required:

"Before and after photos protect both you and the company. The before
photos prove any pre-existing damage wasn't caused by the work. The after
photos show exactly what was done. If there's ever a dispute or warranty
claim, these photos are your documentation. They also help train new techs
and can be used in marketing."

If someone asks about the rating system:

"When the customer rates 4 or 5 stars, you get the option to offer a
5% discount for a Google review. Happy customers leaving reviews helps
the business grow. If they rate 3 or below, the office is automatically
notified so they can follow up while the situation is fresh - sometimes
we can fix issues right then."

================================================================================
                     TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

"Can't proceed to next gate":
  - Check if previous gate requirements are met
  - For photos: at least 1 photo must be taken
  - For signature: canvas can't be blank

"Photos won't upload":
  - May be offline - that's okay, they'll sync later
  - Check device storage space
  - Try restarting the app

"GPS not working":
  - Check location permissions in device settings
  - Make sure GPS/Location Services is enabled
  - May need to step outside if indoors

"Customer won't sign":
  - Cannot complete job without signature
  - Have customer contact office if there's a dispute
  - Do NOT skip signature - it's legally required
