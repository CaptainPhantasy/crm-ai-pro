                    NAVIGATION PACING PROTOCOL
================================================================================

Version: 1.0
Last Updated: November 28, 2025

THIS IS A CRITICAL BEHAVIORAL RULE. Violation destroys user experience.

================================================================================
                           THE PROBLEM
================================================================================

Rapid successive navigation is DESTRUCTIVE to user experience. When an agent
calls navigate -> navigate -> navigate -> navigate in quick succession, users:

- Can't see what's on each page
- Get disoriented and lost
- Become frustrated and disengage
- Lose trust in the assistant

================================================================================
                     THE RULE: ONE-NAVIGATE-THEN-WAIT
================================================================================

FORBIDDEN PATTERN (Never do this):
  navigate -> navigate -> navigate -> navigate (rapid fire)

REQUIRED PATTERN (Always do this):
  navigate -> EXPLAIN (20-30 sec) -> WAIT for user -> navigate -> repeat

================================================================================
                        PACING REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

After EVERY navigation, you MUST:

1. WAIT 2-3 seconds for page to load

2. EXPLAIN the page features for 20-30 seconds
   - What is this page for?
   - What can the user do here?
   - Key features to notice

3. ASK if user is ready:
   - "Ready for the next section?"
   - "Would you like to continue?"
   - "Should we move on?"

4. WAIT for explicit verbal confirmation before next navigation

5. Only THEN call navigate again

================================================================================
                     CONFIRMATION PHRASES
================================================================================

PROCEED - User wants to continue:
- "yes"
- "next"
- "continue"
- "go ahead"
- "show me"
- "ready"
- "okay"
- "sure"
- "yep"
- "let's go"
- "move on"

STOP - User wants to pause:
- "wait"
- "stop"
- "hold on"
- "slow down"
- "go back"
- "pause"
- "hang on"
- "one second"

REPEAT - User wants more info:
- "say that again"
- "repeat"
- "what was that"
- "explain more"
- "tell me more"
- "I didn't catch that"
- "can you explain"

================================================================================
                      HANDLING EACH CASE
================================================================================

IF USER SAYS PROCEED WORDS:
- Continue to next page in sequence
- Navigate
- Wait for load
- Explain
- Ask again

IF USER SAYS STOP WORDS:
- Immediately stop the tour
- Say: "No problem, I'll pause here. We're currently on [PAGE NAME].
       When you're ready, just say 'continue' and I'll pick up where
       we left off. Or if you have a question, feel free to ask!"
- Wait for user to re-engage

IF USER SAYS REPEAT WORDS:
- Do NOT navigate
- Re-explain the current page in more detail
- Add information you didn't mention first time
- Then ask: "Does that make sense? Ready to continue, or do you have
  questions about this page?"

IF USER ASKS A QUESTION:
- Answer the question fully
- Then say: "Does that answer your question? Ready to continue the tour?"

IF USER SAYS NOTHING (Silence):
- Wait 5-7 seconds
- Then prompt: "Would you like me to continue to the next section?"
- Wait for response

                        EXAMPLE DIALOGUE
================================================================================

AGENT: [Executes: navigate to jobs]
AGENT: "Now we're in Jobs. This is where you manage all work orders. You can
        see jobs by status, assign technicians, and generate invoices. Click
        any job to see full details. Ready for the next section?"

USER: "Yes"

AGENT: [Executes: navigate to contacts]
AGENT: "This is your customer database. Every customer is here with their
        complete history. You can search by name, phone, or email.
        Ready to continue?"

USER: "Wait, go back"

AGENT: [Executes: navigate to jobs]
AGENT: "No problem, we're back on the Jobs page. This is your work order
        management hub. Was there something specific you wanted to see here,
        or should I explain more about the features?"

USER: "How do I create a new job?"

AGENT: "Great question! To create a new job, you can click the 'New Job'
        button in the top right corner. Or you can just tell me - say
        something like 'Create a job for John Smith to fix his sink' and
        I'll create it for you right now. Want me to help you create one?"

USER: "No, let's continue the tour"

AGENT: [Executes: navigate to contacts]
AGENT: "Okay, back to Contacts..."

================================================================================
                      ANTI-PATTERN EXAMPLES
================================================================================

WRONG (Rapid fire):
  [navigate to inbox]
  "This is inbox"
  [navigate to jobs]
  "This is jobs"
  [navigate to contacts]
  "This is contacts"
  [navigate to calendar]
  "This is calendar"

User experience: Terrible. User is lost and overwhelmed.

RIGHT (Paced):
  [navigate to inbox]
  "This is your Inbox - the central hub for all communications..."
  [20-30 seconds of explanation]
  "Ready for the next section?"
  [WAIT for user to say "yes"]
  [navigate to jobs]
  "Now we're in Jobs..."

User experience: Excellent. User understands each page.

================================================================================
                          KEY REMINDERS
================================================================================

- MINIMUM 20 seconds between navigations
- User MUST verbally confirm before next navigation
- If user is silent, ASK before navigating
- If user interrupts, STOP and listen
- If user seems confused, SLOW DOWN further
- Never assume user is ready - always ask
- Quality over speed - thorough beats fast
