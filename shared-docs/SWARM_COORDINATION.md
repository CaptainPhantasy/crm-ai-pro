## Coordination Mechanisms

### Progress Tracking Files

Each wave has a progress file that agents update:
- `shared-docs/WAVE1_PROGRESS.md` - Core API progress
- `shared-docs/WAVE2_PROGRESS.md` - Sales/Marketing API progress
- `shared-docs/WAVE3_PROGRESS.md` - Operations API progress
- `shared-docs/WAVE4_PROGRESS.md` - Management API progress
- `shared-docs/WAVE5_PROGRESS.md` - Enterprise API progress
- `shared-docs/WAVE6_PROGRESS.md` - Core MCP tools progress
- `shared-docs/WAVE7_PROGRESS.md` - Enterprise MCP tools progress
- `shared-docs/WAVE8_PROGRESS.md` - Voice integration progress
- `shared-docs/WAVE9_PROGRESS.md` - Documentation progress
- `shared-docs/WAVE10_PROGRESS.md` - Testing progress

### Master Documents

- `shared-docs/API_IMPLEMENTATION_MASTER_PLAN.md` - Complete API inventory
- `shared-docs/MCP_TOOL_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Complete MCP tool inventory
- `shared-docs/API_TO_VOICE_TOOL_MAPPING.md` - API to voice tool mapping
- `shared-docs/AGENT_ORCHESTRATION_STANDARDS.md` - Implementation standards

---

## Parallel Execution Strategy

### After Wave 0 Completes:

**ALL Waves 1-7 execute in parallel:**
- Waves 1-5: Create APIs independently (no cross-dependencies)
- Waves 6-7: Monitor API creation progress and implement MCP tools as APIs become available
- Coordination via shared progress files: `shared-docs/WAVE[N]_PROGRESS.md`

### Progress Tracking Mechanism:

- Each agent updates their wave's progress file
- MCP tool agents (Waves 6-7) read API progress files to know when APIs are ready
- Agents work on available APIs immediately, don't wait for all APIs

---

## Blockers & Dependencies

### Current Blockers
- None (Wave 0 complete)

### Dependencies
- Wave 1-5: No dependencies (can start immediately after Wave 0)
- Wave 6: Depends on Waves 1-5 APIs (monitors progress files)
- Wave 7: Depends on Wave 6 and Waves 2-5 APIs (monitors progress files)
- Wave 8: Depends on Waves 6-7 (all MCP tools complete)
- Wave 9: Depends on all waves (all implementation complete)
- Wave 10: Depends on Wave 9 (documentation complete)

---

## Success Metrics

### Overall Targets
- **~272 REST API endpoints** (70 existing + 82 previously missing + 120 enterprise)
- **~250+ MCP voice tools** (all APIs exposed as voice tools)
- **Complete documentation** (API docs + voice tool docs)
- **Comprehensive testing** (unit + integration + E2E)
- **Production-ready system** (voice-only capable)

### Current Progress
- **APIs**: ~87 verified endpoints (32% of target)
- **MCP Tools**: 21 tools (8% of target)
- **Voice Tools**: ~40 tools (16% of target)

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Wave 0 Complete** - All coordination documents created
2. **Deploy Waves 1-7 ALL IN PARALLEL** after Wave 0 completes
   - All agents MUST read `AGENT_ORCHESTRATION_STANDARDS.md` first
   - All agents MUST update progress files after each completion
   - MCP tool agents (Waves 6-7) read API progress files to know when APIs are ready
3. Execute Wave 8 (Voice integration) after Waves 1-7 complete
4. Execute Waves 9-10 (Docs + Testing) after Wave 8 completes

---

## Agent Instructions (CRITICAL)

### Before Starting Work:

1. **READ**: `shared-docs/AGENT_ORCHESTRATION_STANDARDS.md` completely
2. **READ**: Relevant progress files (`WAVE[N]_PROGRESS.md`)
3. **READ**: `shared-docs/API_INVENTORY.md` or `shared-docs/MCP_TOOL_INVENTORY.md`
4. **VERIFY**: No conflicts with other agents (check progress files)

### During Work:

1. **FOLLOW**: Standards document exactly (no deviations)
2. **UPDATE**: Progress file after each completion
3. **USE**: Templates from standards document
4. **VALIDATE**: All checklist items before marking complete

### After Completing Work:

1. **UPDATE**: Progress file immediately
2. **VERIFY**: No linting errors
3. **VERIFY**: Follows all standards
4. **VERIFY**: Tool names match (MCP = Voice)
